# domino_icons

## Objective
The objective of this repository is to provide a diverse set of standard scale domino svgs that can be used as icons on web based properties or as samples for logos added to real world devices.

## How to use
There are two core groupings of svgs. 
1. 9x9 Masters

   a. Found in `src/9x9_masters` this folder contains variety of 9x9 dominos of a unique design.

   b. All designs in this repository are represented in this folder.

   c. The goal of this folder is to provide "blanks" of various designs that can be used to create other domino representations.

3. Full Sets

   a.Found in `src/full_sets` this folder contains a series of folders that each contain a full set of dominos in a unique design.

   b. The intention of these folders are to allow users to easily access designs that have been edited into a full set of standard dominos. This makes it easy for the designs to be exported to use in different systems with minimal added effort.

## Contribution
Simply create an svg representation of the domino you'd like to add then add it to the relevant grouping in a branch of this repo. Once added create a pull request. If the contribution meets the structure / standards set by other dominos then it will be merged in and added to the project!
